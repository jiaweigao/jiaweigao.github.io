# Research

I am a third year Ph.D student advised by Prof. [Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/).

My research is mainly focused on the exact complexity of problems. My current work involves hardness of problems in PTIME, including lower bounds based on some popular conjectures.

(More introduction of this area can be found on this webpage of Simons Institute:

[Fine-Grained Complexity and Algorithm Design](http://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/complexity2015).) I am also interested in general complexity theory and mathematical logic.
