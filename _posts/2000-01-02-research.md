#Research

I am a second year Ph.D student studying **theoretical computer science** under the adversary of *Russell Impagliazzo* and *Ramamohan Paturi*. I'm interested in topics including:

- Algorithms
- Computational complexity
- Descriptive complexity
- Graph theory
- Algorithmic Game Theory


Currently I am also learning about

- Cryptography
- Mathematical logic

Besides TCS, I am also interested in

- Database theory
- Functional programming
