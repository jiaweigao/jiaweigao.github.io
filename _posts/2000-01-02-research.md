I am a second year Ph.D student studying **theoretical computer science** under the advisary of [Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/) and [Ramamohan Paturi](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/). I'm interested in topics including:

- Algorithms
- Computational complexity
- Descriptive complexity
- Graph theory

Currently I am also learning about

- Cryptography
- Mathematical logic
