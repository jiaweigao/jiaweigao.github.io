#Research

I am a second year Ph.D student advised by Prof. [Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/) and Prof. [Ramamohan Paturi](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/). I'm interested in Algorithms, Computational Complexity and Graph theory.

Currently I am doing research on the lower bounds of problems that are solvable in PTIME.
