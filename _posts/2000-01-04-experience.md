# Experience

###2013
I graduated from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) with a bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://www.software.fudan.edu.cn/index.shtml). [Rudolf Fleischer](http://www.tcs.fudan.edu.cn/rudolf/) was my undergraduate advisor. I did some research on graph algorithms and algorithmic game theory.

###2012
In the summer of 2012, I was exchanged at [3G Lab](http://3glab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/), National Tsing Hua University under the instruction of Prof. [Sheung-Hung Poon](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~spoon/) and Dr. Ton Kloks.
