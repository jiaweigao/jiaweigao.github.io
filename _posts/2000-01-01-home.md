I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, advised by [Prof. Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/). I work on Theoretical Computer Science. My research is mainly focused on algorithms and computational complexity, especially in fine-grained complexity.
