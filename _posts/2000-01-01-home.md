I am a third year Ph.D student advised by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Prof. Russell Impagliazzo</a>. My research is mainly focused on algorithms and complexity theory.

My current projects is about hardness of problems in PTIME, including lower bounds based on some popular conjectures.
