## About My Research

I am a third year Ph.D student studying Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, advised by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Prof. Russell Impagliazzo</a>. My research is mainly focused on algorithms and complexity theory, especially in exact complexity of problems.

My current projects is about hardness of problems in PTIME, including lower bounds based on some popular conjectures.

I am also interested in topics such as derandomization, pseudorandomness and circuit lower bounds. In addition to complexity theory, I would like to look into mathematical logic, and try to find connections between these two areas.
