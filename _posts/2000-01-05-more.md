#More

- I grew up in [Handan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handan), Hebei Province, China. The city's history dates back to the Warring States period, when it was the capital of the Zhao State.

- I took part in the *National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces* when attending high school. That was the first time when I was attracted by algorithms.

- I play video games, mainly Nintendo (Mario, Kirby, etc.), even if I'm a bad player. I'm a huge fan of the Fire Emblem series and Ace Attorney series.

- I am an expert in finding tiny size women clothes!

- I have [Grapheme-€“color synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme%E2%80%93color_synesthesia).
